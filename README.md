Hokm Android Project - Complete Source (Hokm-Project.zip)

This archive contains the complete Android Studio project source ready to upload to GitHub.
Because this environment cannot run Android SDK and build tools, I cannot produce a real APK here.
Instead, this package includes a GitHub Actions workflow that will build the APK on GitHub's runners automatically.

Contents:
- app/ (full Android app module with Jetpack Compose skeleton and placeholder assets)
- .github/workflows/android.yml (workflow that installs Gradle and runs assembleDebug on GitHub Actions)
- build.gradle, settings.gradle, gradle.properties
- gradlew and gradlew.bat (scripts included)
- gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties (distribution URL present) -- **gradle-wrapper.jar is NOT included** because binary downloads are not available here.
  The workflow is configured to use the Gradle Action so gradle-wrapper.jar is not required for CI builds.


Instructions (simple):
1) Extract this ZIP on your computer.
2) Upload all extracted files and folders (not the ZIP itself) to the root of a new GitHub repository.
3) Commit changes and go to the Actions tab. The workflow will run automatically on the `main` branch.
4) When it completes successfully, open the run and download the artifact named `hokm-apk` which contains `app-debug.apk`.

If you want me to also include gradle-wrapper.jar inside gradle/wrapper, say so and I will prepare a separate downloadable package containing it.
